# Minesweeper Game

This is a Minesweeper game done in HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

## Getting Started
Enter the number of mines, number of rows and number of columns you want your minesweeper game to have, then click 'Create New Game' to begin your game!

Your first click in the grid is guaranteed not to be a mine, but after that all bets are off!

Avoid the mines by using the numbers revealed by your clicks. For example, a '5' means that of the 8 squares around that square, 5 of them have mines.

If you click on a '0' square, it will automatically reveal the squares around it, so get those tiles early if you can!

Use right click to mark a square to keep better track of the bombs you have already found. Don't worry, you can right click again to remove the mark or just click it if you're confident that there's no bomb.

You win if you reveal all of the numbers while avoiding all of the mines. Good luck!

## Next Steps
While the game is already in a good state, I am looking to add the ability to futher adjust the grid size after the grid is made.
