# Minesweeper Game

This is a Minesweeper game done in HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

## Getting Started
Enter the number of mines, number of rows and number of columns you want your minesweeper game to have, then click 'Create New Game' to begin your game!

Your first click in the grid is guaranteed not to be a mine, but after that all bets are off!

Avoid the mines by using the numbers revealed by your clicks. For example, a '5' means that of the 8 squares around that square, 5 of them have mines.

If you click on a '0' square, it will automatically reveal the squares around it, so get those tiles early if you can!

You win if you reveal all of the numbers while avoiding all of the mines. Good luck!

## Next Steps
While the game is already in a good state, I am looking to add flags and question marks to mark mines that you are aware of.
